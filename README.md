# AMB_flexible-rotor-system
Detailed introduction of the parameters and modeling of the AMB-flexible rotor system.
Including photos of the AMB-flexible rotor system components, finite element model, and parameter files.

Remark 1: The first-order flexible critical speed in the Campbell diagram is approximately 3200 rpm, and the second-order critical speed is approximately 6000 rpm. To save space in the article, a rotational speed of 6000 rpm is selected to compare the control performance of various algorithms near the critical speed.
